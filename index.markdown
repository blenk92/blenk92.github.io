## About this Blog

This page is my attempt to gain some practical experience in breaking into products. I have a few years of hands-on experience in defensive product security, but now I'm wondering how other products out there are protected (or not :-D). Anyway, I'm not exactly sure where this will lead and how much time I'm going to spend. For now, I'm trying to share whatever I figure out...
